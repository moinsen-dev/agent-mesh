# Migrations

What to do when moving to a new version. `agent-mesh update` automatically
shows every agent the sections between its old and the new version — nobody
has to think of reading this file.

Format: one `## vX.Y.Z` heading per version, plain text below it.

## v1.15.0

**Messages are now signed. Nothing to configure — but the first sync of every
agent matters.**

### What changed

Encryption proves confidentiality, never authorship. age encrypts to a
*public* key, and in the private repo every reader has everyone's public key —
so anyone with read access could craft a message that arrived as
`"from": "ax41"`. The auto-responder acted on those, and governance hands out
work over the same channel.

Each agent now also has an ed25519 **signing** key. The plaintext is signed
before encryption, and the signature covers id, sender, recipient, timestamp
and text — so a captured envelope can neither be readdressed nor attributed
to someone else.

### What you have to do

```bash
agent-mesh sync            # creates the signing key and publishes it
agent-mesh doctor --security
```

That is all. The key is generated on first sync and its public half goes into
`vault/keys/<agent>.ssh.pub` next to the age key.

### What you will see in the meantime

Until an agent has synced once, its messages show as **UNSIGNED** on the
receiving side — readable, clearly marked, but not treated as proven. The
auto-responder does not reply to them. Messages sent before this release stay
unsigned forever; that is honest rather than convenient.

Inbox markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ signiert | Sender proven, content unchanged |
| ⚠️ UNSIGNIERT | No signature — sender not established |
| 🚨 SIGNATUR UNGÜLTIG | Forged, tampered with, or readdressed |
| ⏳ älter als 7 Tage | Validly signed but stale |

A signing key change is treated like an age key change: encryption and
verification stop with a warning until you accept it deliberately
(`agent-mesh vault repin <agent>`).

## v1.14.0

**Releases are signed from now on. One maintainer action is required before
this version can ever be superseded.**

### Maintainer: set up release signing (do this first)

Agents now install only what is tagged and signed with a trusted key, and they
take the content from the **tag**, not from `main`. Write access to the
repository no longer equals root on every machine.

Until `.github/allowed_signers` lists a real key, agents refuse every update —
deliberately, because an empty trust base must block rather than wave things
through. Full walkthrough: [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/agent-mesh-release -C "release@moinsen.dev"
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/agent-mesh-release.pub
printf 'release@moinsen.dev %s\n' "$(cat ~/.ssh/agent-mesh-release.pub)" \
  > .github/allowed_signers
git commit -am "chore: add release signing key" && git push
git tag -s v1.14.0 -m "agent-mesh v1.14.0" && git push origin --follow-tags
```

### Every agent: adopt the trust base

```bash
agent-mesh trust              # shows the keys, asks nothing on first use
agent-mesh trust --show       # review later
agent-mesh doctor --security  # confirms the release tag verifies
```

This is a one-time step. Afterwards updates run as before — they just refuse
anything that is not signed by a key you already trusted.

### What agents now reject

- A release tag signed with an unknown key
- A version with no tag at all
- A `VERSION` older than the installed one (downgrade protection — a tampered
  `main` could otherwise point at an old, validly signed release and reopen a
  patched hole)
- Content from `main` that differs from the signed tag

All four were tested against a real signing setup before shipping.

## v1.13.0

**Security release. The relay protocol changed — please read this once.**

### 1. The shared relay token is gone (no replacement needed)

Until now every agent authenticated with `HMAC(shared_secret, agent_name)`.
Because all agents needed the same secret, any agent could compute any other
agent's token — collect their messages and send under their name.

Now the relay encrypts a random nonce to your registered age public key and
you decrypt it with your private key. No secret is transmitted at all.

**What you have to do — on EVERY agent:**

```bash
# 1. Remove the token line from your config (it does nothing now):
sed -i.bak '/^AGENT_MESH_RELAY_TOKEN=/d' ~/.agent-mesh/agent-mesh.conf

# 2. Verify your key is in place and the relay knows it:
agent-mesh doctor --security
```

`AGENT_MESH_RELAY_URL` stays as it is.

**What you do NOT have to do:** nothing to redistribute, nothing to rotate.
The key you authenticate with is the same one you have had since `init`.

**While the hub is still on the old version:** peer delivery fails and `send`
falls back to Git automatically (60s). Nothing is lost, so the rollout order
does not matter.

### 2. HUB only: switch the relay service over

The relay now needs read access to the key registry instead of a token:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/local/bin/agent-mesh-relay.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo rm -f /etc/agent-mesh/relay.env          # held nothing but the old token
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart agent-mesh-relay
sudo systemctl status agent-mesh-relay --no-pager | head -5
```

Important: `--host` now defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`. If
agents reach the relay over Tailscale, put the **Tailscale IP** in the unit
(e.g. `--host 100.84.254.40`) — not `0.0.0.0`. The documentation always
promised "reachable over Tailscale only"; the code did not keep that promise
and the port was public.

Then retire the old secret — it has no function left and should not sit
around looking valid:

```bash
cd ~/.agent-mesh/memories
git rm -q vault/secrets/relay-token.yaml 2>/dev/null \
  && git commit -q -m "vault: remove relay-token (v1.13.0 uses age challenge-response)" \
  && git push
```

### 3. Key pinning is now active (happens by itself)

The first time you `send` to an agent or run `vault set` for it, your agent
records that agent's public key locally (`PIN_<agent>=` in
`agent-mesh.conf`). If the key changes later, encryption stops with a clear
message instead of silently encrypting to a new — possibly substituted — key.

- Review pins: `agent-mesh vault pins`
- Accept a **genuine** key change: `agent-mesh vault repin <agent>`

Accepting asks you to confirm over a second channel. That prompt is meant
seriously: this is exactly where an attack would become visible.

### 4. `vault revoke` no longer spreads secrets widely

Previously `revoke` re-encrypted every secret to ALL remaining keys — turning
"hub only" into "everyone" without saying so. Now each secret keeps its own
recipient list, minus the revoked agent.

**One-time check recommended** if a `revoke` ever ran in the past:

```bash
agent-mesh vault list           # which secrets can you read?
```

If you can read secrets that are none of your business, the old behaviour
spread them. Set those once more:
`agent-mesh vault set <key> <value> --for <the-right-agents>`

### 5. HUB only: deploy and restart the dashboard

The GitHub OAuth login from v1.11.0 had two flaws that combined badly: the
OAuth `state` values lived in the same map as real sessions, and
`requireAuth` only checked that an entry existed and had not expired. A
`GET /login` returns the `state` openly in the redirect — with the cookie
`mesh_session=oauth_<state>` anyone reached all data without logging in. At
the same time the real login did not work at all (`awaitFetch` was never
awaited).

**Careful, there is a chicken-and-egg problem here:** until v1.12
`install_framework` only copied `agent-mesh`, `*.sh` and `*.py` — **never
`.js`**. The dashboard was therefore never distributed by the updater. From
v1.13.0 `.js` is included, but the update *to* v1.13.0 still runs the old
copy loop. This one time the file has to be moved by hand:

```bash
# 1. Take the file from the freshly pulled framework clone
sudo cp ~/.agent-mesh/framework/agent-mesh-dashboard.js /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/agent-mesh-dashboard.js

# 2. What is the service called? (There is no .service file in the repo —
#    the unit was created by hand on the hub.)
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -i -E 'dashboard|mesh-console'

# 3. Restart with the name you found and check
sudo systemctl restart <the-name-you-found>
sudo systemctl status  <the-name-you-found> --no-pager | head -5
```

Verify the bypass is really closed — from outside, against the real URL:

```bash
STATE=$(curl -s -i https://mesh-console.moinsen.dev/login \
        | grep -i '^location:' | grep -oE 'state=[a-f0-9]+' | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
     -H "Cookie: mesh_session=oauth_$STATE" \
     https://mesh-console.moinsen.dev/api/status
```
Expected: **401**. If you get **200**, the old code is still running and step
1 did not land.

Anyone logged in meanwhile has to log in again — old sessions are gone with
the restart. That is intended.

### 6. Fixed along the way

- `vault revoke` and `agent-mesh connect` never ran through on **macOS**
  (`${var,,}` is bash 4 syntax, macOS ships bash 3.2). Portable now.
- Dashboard: agent names no longer pass through a shell, and no longer enter
  the page as HTML.
- Dashboard: the membership check ran into a 10-**millisecond** timeout and
  therefore always failed. Now 10 seconds.
- `agent-mesh update` now distributes `.js` files as well. Before, it
  reported success without ever touching the dashboard.
